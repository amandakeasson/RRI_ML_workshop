# Materials for the Introduction to Machine Learning Workshop


Links to Jupyter notebooks will be posted here by May 9th!

You have two options for running the Jupyter notebooks:


#### OPTION 1: run on Google Colab

This way, you wonâ€™t need to install anything on your own laptop!

#### OPTION 2: run locally

Miniconda: download and install from https://conda.io/miniconda.html (choose the Python 3.6 version)  

Open Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) and run the following:

`conda create -n rriML python=3  

source activate rriML  

conda install git  

conda install jupyter  

cd ~  

git clone https://www.github.com/amandakeasson/rriML  

cd rriML  

pip install -r requirements.txt  

python download_nilearn_data.py`
